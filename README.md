# Walmart Business Case Analysis: Confidence Interval and Central Limit Theorem

This project focuses on analyzing customer purchase behavior at Walmart, with a specific emphasis on purchase amounts in relation to customer gender and other factors. The analysis aims to provide insights to help Walmart's management make data-driven decisions, particularly concerning spending habits during Black Friday.

# Business Problem

The Management team at Walmart Inc. is interested in understanding the purchase behavior of their customers, especially how spending habits differ between male and female customers. Key questions include:

- Do women spend more on Black Friday than men?
- How do various factors like age, marital status, and city category influence purchase amounts?

# Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains transactional data of customers who made purchases at Walmart stores during Black Friday. It includes features such as:

- User_ID
- Product_ID
- Gender
- Age
- Occupation
- City_Category
- StayInCurrentCityYears
- Marital_Status
- ProductCategory
- Purchase Amount

# Analysis Objectives

- Customer Purchase Behavior: Analyze purchase amounts against customer gender and various factors to support better decision-making.
- Gender-based Spending: Determine if women spend more than men on Black Friday.
- Confidence Intervals: Use the Central Limit Theorem to compute confidence intervals for the average spending of male and female customers.
- Insights and Recommendations: Provide actionable insights based on the analysis.

# Analytical Solution Requirements
- Data Import & Exploration: Import the dataset and perform standard exploratory data analysis, including detecting null values and outliers.
- Data Exploration: Track and compare spending per transaction for female and male customers, and calculate averages.
- Statistical Analysis: Compute confidence intervals for average spending using sample data and the Central Limit Theorem. Observe the distribution of mean expenses by varying sample sizes and confidence levels.
- Comparison and Conclusions: Analyze if the confidence intervals of average spending for male and female customers overlap. Extend the analysis to compare spending by marital status and age groups.
- Recommendations: Based on the findings, suggest ways Walmart can leverage these insights to improve customer experience and increase sales.

# Conclusion
This project aims to provide a detailed analysis of customer spending behavior at Walmart, focusing on gender differences during Black Friday. The insights gained will help Walmart's management team make informed decisions to enhance their business strategies and customer offerings.
